## What is website-archetype?

website-archetype uses [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com) and a modified
version of [startbootstrap's](http://startbootstrap.com) simple-sidebar
template to create stylish websites that are simple to manage.

Page content can be in markdown or html.  This combination allows nice design
 with minimal effort to create new pages.

Combined with a heroku account, updating a project website can be achieved with
modification to some markdown and a git push.
