# Documentation for website-archetype

Here, we will cover [installation](/docs/installation.html) and running (via [local](/docs/running_local_server.html) and [heroku](/docs/pushing_to_heroku.html) server) of website-archetype.

For your project website, you'll want to talk about installation, pdf documentation, and any other sort of procesess required to run your projet.
