BayesDB
==============

BayesDB is an open-source implementation of a predictive database table. It introduces the Bayesian Query Language (BQL), which provides predictive extensions to SQL that enable users to query the implications of their data --- predict missing entries, identify predictive relationships between columns, and examine synthetic populations --- based on a Bayesian machine learning system in the backend.

The [BayesDB website](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/bayesdb) is the primary source of information about BayesDB.
